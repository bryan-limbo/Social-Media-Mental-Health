## Social Media and Mental Health

A self-initiated data analysis project exploring the relationship between social media usage and mental health. Using SQL for data processing and analysis and Tableau for visualization, this project aims to uncover patterns and insights within the dataset.

### Objective

This project seeks to analyze social media usage patterns and their potential impact on mental health. By examining user demographics, time spent on platforms, and the correlation with mental health indicators, the goal is to identify trends and insights that could inform mental health support strategies and contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between social media engagement and well-being.

### Data

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, is available under the [Open Database License (ODbL)](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1-0/), which allows for open access and modification, provided that any derived data is shared alike. This dataset contains demographic information, social media usage, and self-reported mental health indicators, offering a valuable foundation for exploring potential correlations between social media engagement and mental well-being.

### Tools

- SQL: Used to clean, process, and analyze the dataset, including filtering, aggregating, and categorizing data for specific insights.
- Tableau: Utilized to visualize key findings, allowing for the creation of interactive charts and dashboards that reveal patterns in social media use and mental health correlations.
